# CONTEXT: WHAT FASTEST IS (SIMPLIFIED, V1)

Fastest exists to keep **projects and their state in sync across interfaces** (CLI + Web),
not to remotely execute code or stream processes.

The core idea is simple:

- The **CLI** is where work happens (agents run locally).
- The **Cloud** is a durable, shared memory.
- The **Web UI** is a read/write interface to that memory.
- Both interfaces operate on the **same primitives**.

No remote execution.
No streaming logs.
No device control.
No job protocol.

Just **projects, snapshots, status, and continuity**.

This document set reflects that simplified V1.
