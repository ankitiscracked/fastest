# Web UI – V1

## Purpose
The Web UI is an **alternate interface** to the same project state as the CLI.

It does NOT:
- run code
- edit files
- execute agents

---

## Pages

### Auth
- Login / logout

### Projects
- List projects
- Create project
- Show last activity

### Project detail
- project_id
- snapshots list
- last snapshot
- status timeline (last N events)
- CLI instructions:
  - fast link
  - fast clone

---

## UX goal
From a phone or browser, a user can:
- create a project
- see latest project state
- resume work later on CLI by pulling the snapshot
